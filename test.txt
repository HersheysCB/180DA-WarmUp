How to avoid telling people my major (computer science)
When people ask me what my major and school is, I'm hesitant to say. It's probably rare for them to be graced with the presence of a student at the top cs/engineering school in the U.S., the MIT of California. Especially a computer science major, the most prestigious program at said school. I feel a bit guilty, as meeting someone so much more accomplished, yet their same age, probably crushes their self image.

How do you guys go about avoiding the question, or what other major do you usually say?
